- I made these files to track my progress.
- Created a Banking Example where I put the key elements learned together.


## Usage
>You can get started with Go by creating a new file named anything with `{name}.go`.

To run any of my files, use the following command (after downloading [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)):

```
go run {filename}.go
```

You can also build the files as executables by running the following:

```
go build {filename}.go
```

>To run the banking example, navigate to the `banking_example_v1` folder, then proceed with the commands above on the file: `main.go`.
